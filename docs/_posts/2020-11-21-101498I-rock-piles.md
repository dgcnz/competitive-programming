title: 101498I - Rock Piles

 [Maybe this is flawed, but it got AC. Nevertheless, here's my reasoning.]
 - Let's define:
     1. Even state: 2 piles have an even amount of rocks.
     2. Odd state: not even state.
 - If a player is on an even state, the second player can always force him to
be on even states.
 - So, since the end state has trivially an even state, then whoever
starts on an uneven state can force the second player to lose by keeping him
on even states.
