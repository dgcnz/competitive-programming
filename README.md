This repository is personal, made public in the hope that someone find it useful.


A few notes:
- All the solutions should be correct, and if not, please raise an issue to notify me. 
- Solutions might be illegible, but I mostly try to make them less so.
- Solutions might contain inefficient and (perhaps) weird implementations. I've experimented a bit with C++ templates and functional practices, so be warned.
- All the solutions are written by me, unless specified otherwise. If you find borrowed solutions without references to their respective original authors, please let me know (in an issue).
- For newer problems (>11/2020) there will be (when I'm not lazy) a javadoc-styled file comment that gives a brief overview of the solution.
